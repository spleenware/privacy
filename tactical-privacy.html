<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Location Data</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The app captures the device’s location, even when in the background AND the long range radio is connected. If you disconnect the radio, then background location gathering ceases. The location data is never transmitted over the internet, nor is it stored on the device, by this app. The data is encrypted and transmitted to your Ripple Tactical team. Only team members who have exchanged keys with you can decrypt the data.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Security</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Your data is only ever transmitted over the long range radio, and is encrypted with 256-bit ECC encryption. But remember that no method of transmission, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
